# Gamehub Website (Written in React)

https://react-game-hub-dusky.vercel.app/  <--- check it out here!!!

My hands on result from learning Typescript, React, and web development.

This was a really fun project, even despite all the learning pains. UI design, API request, hooks/states, deployment, and how to organize a project without collapsing from exhaustion. Very cool would recommend :+1:

(If you get a network error please try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work then I've run out of api request.)
